## 👋 Hello everyone!

Mechanical engineer turned software developer — now working as a **freelance full-stack developer**. Driven by curiosity and a passion for understanding how systems work, from low-level C programs to distributed web architectures.  

I focus on building **scalable web applications** and **developer-friendly APIs**, combining strong backend foundations with modern frontend frameworks. Always open to **collaborations and freelance opportunities** involving backend design, system integration, or end-to-end application development.


## 💼 What I’m Working On

I design and build **full-stack applications** using:  
- **.NET / C#** and **Node.js + TypeScript** for backend APIs and services  
- **Next.js + React** for frontend development  
- **PostgreSQL / MSSQL** for data storage  
- **Docker, Coolify, and Harbor** for self-hosted deployments and CI/CD automation  

Recent professional experience includes:  
- Creating REST API endpoints and managing **validation logic** with consistent success/error responses  
- Implementing **NUnit testing** for end-to-end API verification  
- Setting up **GitHub Actions** pipelines for automated testing on merges and pull requests  
- Designing and maintaining **microservice communication** patterns using RabbitMQ  

I also run a **self-hosted web infrastructure** for personal and client projects, integrating Strapi CMS, PostgreSQL, and automated Docker-based deployments.

## 🌐 Other Work

Beyond my main projects, I maintain and self-host several smaller services and internal tools, including my **personal website** built with **Next.js + Strapi CMS**, backed by **PostgreSQL** and deployed automatically through **GitHub Actions → Harbor → Coolify**.  
These setups help me continuously experiment with **DevOps automation** and **self-hosted workflows** for real-world deployment pipelines.



## 💬 Collaboration & Problem-Solving  

I enjoy discussing architecture, exploring design options, and reasoning through how different systems interact. When solving problems, I often explain concepts through diagrams or practical examples — helping others quickly grasp the logic behind a solution.  

Brainstorming is one of my favorite parts of development. I like comparing potential approaches, weighing their trade-offs, and finding the option that brings **real added value to the client or project**.  

My learning mindset naturally grew during my time at **42 Prague**, where the philosophy is simple: *“Here’s the task — now figure out how to make it work.”* That environment taught me how to research, verify, and experiment until I truly understand how a technology or system functions.  

This mindset also helped me make a complete career shift from mechanical engineering to software development — and it still drives me today. I continue to learn, explore new frameworks, and refine my craft every day.

## 🧠 Background

I graduated in **Mechanical Engineering at CTU in Prague** and started my career designing automated production systems. My drive to automate workflows naturally evolved into programming — leading me to join **42 Prague**, where I learned to build software from first principles.

During my **Common Core studies**, I worked entirely in a **Linux environment**, developing projects in C and C++ that covered:  
- Process, threads and memory management  
- Socket programming and event-driven servers  
- Modular C++ design and system-level problem solving  

After completing the program, I shifted my focus to full-stack web development, combining my systems-level understanding with modern backend and frontend technologies.

## 🚀 42 Prague Highlights

### **[Transcendence](https://github.com/orezek/Transcendence)**  
Final 42 Common Core project — a **multiplayer Pong web game** built using a **microservice architecture** (managed via Docker Compose).  
- Designed and implemented the **game engine from scratch**, including matchmaking and multiple game modes (split-keyboard, tournament, online multiplayer).  
- Used **WebSockets** for real-time communication and **RabbitMQ** for inter-service messaging.  
- Contributed to the frontend in **JavaScript/TypeScript** using **Vite** and a lightweight router.  

### **[ft_irc](https://github.com/orezek/IRCserver)**  
A complete IRC server in **C++**, implementing networking, socket management, and custom command parsing. This project gave me an in-depth understanding of **asynchronous I/O**, connection management, and protocol design.  

### **[minishell](https://github.com/m-bartos/42_minishell)**  
A **mini bash shell** written in **C**, handling processes, pipes, redirections, and signal control. It deepened my understanding of **memory management**, **process forking**, and **Linux internals**.  

Other key 42 projects covered topics such as containerization (Inception), virtual machine setup (Born2beroot), and foundational C/C++ programming.
