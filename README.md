## Hello everyone!

The mechanical engineer now transforming into the IT and software world. Eager to learn how things work, and how computers and applications are made. Open for any part-time job or other code-related tasks, projects, or work. Don't hesitate to contact me!

## Background
I studied mechanical engineering at the CTU in Prague. During my studies, I automated various tasks using Excel sheets and small Matlab and Python scripts. Repetitive work isn't my forte, so automation became a natural inclination. ðŸ˜ƒ

After two years as a mechanical designer of automation lines, I decided to dive into programming. My coding journey started with a basic Python course on Udemy. However, I soon realised that I could write code without really understanding its underlying principles.

This realization led me to enroll in 42 Prague, where I started from the ground up with C programming. After completing a four-week-long selection boot camp in October 2023, I was accepted as a student and I am currently finishing my 42 Prague Common Core studies.

Through C/C++ projects like minishell, where we coded our own little bash, or coding our own irc messaging server, I was close enough to understand the core functionalities of Linux, such as processes, sockets and so on. Now I am exploring how the web applications are made through the last project of 42Prague. I expect to gain more experience in full-stack development.

## 42 Prague
I am currently exploring microservices, Javascript, Typescript, Fastify, C# and SQL.
