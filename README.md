## Hello everyone!

The mechanical engineer now transforming into the IT and software world. Eager to learn how things work, and how computers and applications are made. Open for any part-time job or other code-related tasks, projects, or work. Don't hesitate to contact me!

## Background
I studied mechanical engineering at CTU in Prague. Throughout my university years, I automated various tasks using Excel sheets and small Matlab and Python scripts. Repetitive work isn't my forte; hence, automation became a natural inclination. ðŸ˜ƒ

Following two years as a mechanical designer for automation lines, I decided to dive into coding. My coding journey began with a basic Python course, [100daysOfCode](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). However, I soon realized I could write code without truly comprehending its underlying principles.

This realization led me to enroll in 42 Prague, where I started from the ground up with C programming. After completing a four-week-long selection boot camp, I was accepted as a student and I am currently immersed in the 42 Prague Common Core program full-time.

Choosing C as my starting point has proven beneficial, given its proximity to the Unix terminal, making everything click. I anticipate gaining more experience in C and exploring object-oriented programming with C++, C#, Python, Java, or other languages in the future.

## 42 Prague
I am currently exploring the basics of Docker, C++98 standard, SQL and C#.
